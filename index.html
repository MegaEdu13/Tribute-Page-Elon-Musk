					Down bellow are some of Musk's deeds and his path through life:
				</h3>

				<h4 id="path">Childhood and Early Life</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. The
						oldest of three siblings with a prodigious family name, he grew up
						in the last decades of Apartheid.
					</li>
					<li>
						His parents were Maye Musk, a British-Canadian model and Errol Musk,
						a South Africa born British electrical engineer. When they divorced
						in 1980, Elon stayed mainly with his father in South Africa. A few
						years later, he began teaching himself computer programming and sold
						his first video game at the age of 12.
					</li>
					<li>
						For his undergraduate education he attended the Queen’s University
						in Kingston, Ontario, in 1990. He eventually transferred to the
						University of Pennsylvania, earning dual degree in Physics and
						Economics.
					</li>
					<li>
						In addition to the bachelor’s degrees, he earned in physics and
						economics, he also holds an honorary doctorate in Design from the
						‘Art Center College of Design’ and an honorary doctorate in
						Aerospace Engineering from the ‘University of Surrey’.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 id="path">Career</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>
						He moved to California to attend Stanford for a PhD in applied
						physics in 1995, but quit within a few of days to pursue his own
						interests in avenues of technology and entrepreneurship. Later that
						year, he worked with his brother, Kimbal Musk, to develop the
						software company ‘Zip2’, which provided services to high end
						newspaper clients like 'The New York Times' and the 'Chicago
						Tribune'.
					</li>
					<li>
						After the successful sale of Zip2 to Compaq in 1999, Musk went
						straight into his next venture, an online financial service called
						‘X.com’. Shortly after the company acquired a money transfer service
						called ‘PayPal’, through a merger, they began to focus their efforts
						exclusively on building this internet payment service. The success
						of ‘PayPal’ led Musk to sell his stock in the company to ‘eBay’ for
						$165 million.
					</li>
					<li>
						In 2002, he invested his millions in his third company ‘Space
						Exploration Technologies’ or just ‘SpaceX’. Within seven years, the
						company had designed the ‘Falcon’ line of space launch vehicles and
						the ‘Dragon’ line of multi-purpose spacecraft and was making history
						with their privately funded innovation. ‘SpaceX’ received contracts
						from NASA to create a launch craft to deliver cargo to the
						‘International Space Station’.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tesla Motors was founded with the mission of designing and building
						electric cars. Musk invested in the company and became its chairman
						in 2004, a year after its inception, taking on an active role in the
						design of the ‘Roadster’, which won the ‘Global Green’ product
						award. During the recession when the company was adversely affected,
						he went on to become the CEO and product architect of the company, a
						role he holds till today.
					</li>
					<li>
						After designing the initial concept for ‘SolarCity’, Musk remains
						its biggest shareholder. Today, it is the second largest provider of
						solar energy in the United States, with a focus on combating global
						warming.
					</li>
					<li>
						On August 12, 2013, Musk announced revolutionary plans for a high
						speed travel technology that, in theory, could replace airplane
						travel as a faster and cheaper option. His company ‘SpaceX’ is
						currently working on putting his plans into practice, with the
						design intended to run entirely on solar energy.
					</li>
					<li>
						He has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the
						Hyperloop. It incorporates reduced-pressure tubes in which
						pressurized capsules ride on air bearings driven by linear induction
						motors and air compressors.
					</li>
					<li>
						In July 2017, he announced that first successful test run of
						Hyperloop has been done in Nevada. He also said that he has got
						verbal approval to build a hyperloop from New York City to
						Washington D.C.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 id="path">Major Works</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>
						SpaceX has completed several contracts for NASA, sending its Falcon
						9 spacecraft to the International Space Station with cargo. This
						spacecraft replaced the space shuttle when it retired in 2011.
					</li>
					<li>
						Musk was heavily involved in the design of Tesla Motors' first
						electric sports car, the ‘Tesla Roadster’. Musk received the 2006
						‘Global Green’ product design award for this vehicle, presented by
						Mikhail Gorbachev.
					</li>
				</ul>
